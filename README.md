# Welcome
In this exercise I learned a lot about Flexbox by followed the directions outlined by [Ohans Emmanual](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af). This exercise covered the basics of what Flexbox is and tied core concepts together by creating a static frontend for a music application using Flexbox.

# Why I Completed the Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
Ohans does a great job at explaining what Flexbox is, what problems it solves, what the tool will replace, and why it isnâ€™t used everywhere just yet. The tutorial gave plenty of examples and really came together while  building the music player application. I particularly enjoyed how Ohans left it to readers to implement the footer code. While it was somewhat challenging to get the CSS right, with a bit of backtracking I finished the exercise and am very happy with the end results! I would gladly recommend this exercise to a friend that is interested in learning more about Flexbox.
